//Write a program to find the difference between time of 2 clocks using structureâ€¦

struct diff
{
    int hour,min,sec;
};
int main()
{
    struct diff c1,c2,*p1,*p2;
    p1=&c1;
    p2=&c2;
    void sub(struct diff *p1,struct diff *p2);
    sub(&c1,&c2);
}
void sub(struct diff *p1,struct diff *p2)
{
    struct diff difference;
    printf("\n enter time at first clock(hour:minute:second):");
    scanf("%d%d%d",&p1->hour,&p1->min,&p1->sec);
    printf("\n enter time at second clock(hour:minute:second):");
    scanf("%d%d%d",&p2->hour,&p2->min,&p2->sec);
    difference.hour=abs( p1->hour - p2->hour);
    difference.min=abs(p1->min-p2->min);
    difference.sec=abs(p1->sec-p2->sec);
    printf("\n difference= %d hours %d min %d sec",difference.hour,difference.min,difference.sec);
}

Output:
enter time at first clock(hour:minute:second):48
23
79

 enter time at second clock(hour:minute:second):15
76
62

 difference= 33 hours 53 min 17 sec
