//Input Radius, if it is <10 then calculate area of circle else calculate volume of cylinder

int main()
{
    float r,h,a,v;
    printf("\n enter radius less than 10 for area of circle and greater than 10 for volume of cylinder:");
    printf("\n enter radius:");
    scanf("%f",&r);
    if(r<10)
    {
        a=3.14*r*r;
        printf("\n area of circle:%f",a);
    }
    else
    {
        printf("\n enter height of cylinder:");
        scanf("%f",&h);
        v=3.14*r*r*h;
        printf("\n volume of cylinder:%f",v);
    }
}

Output:
enter radius less than 10 for area of circle and greater than 10 for volume of cylinder:
 enter radius:
5

 area of circle:78.500000

AND
enter radius less than 10 for area of circle and greater than 10 for volume of cylinder:
 enter radius:
11

 enter height of cylinder:5

 volume of cylinder:1899.699951
